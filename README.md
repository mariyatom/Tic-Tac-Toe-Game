# Tic-Tac-Toe

Set up game defaults (whose turn it is, and whether the game is over)

Handle clicks using an event object (e) to figure out which cell was clicked.

Where you're at now (after Part I of cellClicked): You can detect clicks and log the clicked cell. âœ…

What's next? You'll want to start making the cell actually display an X or O depending on whose turn it is! Then:

Switch the turn to the other player

Update the subtitle with "Now it's O's turn!" or "Now it's X's turn!"

Check for a winner after each move

Declare the winner if the game ends
